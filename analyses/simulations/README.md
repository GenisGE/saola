# Do forward simulations of genetic load with slim

Use slim to run population genetic simulations of genetic load under inferred saola demographic history, to study impact of demography on genetic load and purging, and test viability under different future scenarios.

Did the simulations with two alternative models of hte distribution of selection and dominance coefficients, the 'perez-pereira model' and the 'kyriazis model'. See mansucript for details and references to the models.

# Estimate relatedness between pairs of samples

Pipeline to estimate relatedness between pairs of sampels using NGSrelateV2.

It separates the samples into the two populations since some of the relatedness estiamtors use allele frequencies. Then estiamtes genotype likelihoods for each set of samples and runs NGSrelatev2 on them.
